How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  To ensure what I develop or work on is functional and secure I can follow the secure coding guidlines or use an external scanner
  such as Snyk to scan my code for know vulnerablities. To help with funcionality I could make sure my method names, variable names, 
  and methods are simple and easy to follow. This will decrease the chance of misusing variable and methods. Also making sure I write
  tests that check requiremnts and functionality of the methods. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  To effectively interpret user needs review the design documnets and look for key points. After finding the main points I reread
  throught and find all of the requirments that are related. Having them split into requirements that are similar I find it easier
  to incorporate them fully.
  
How do I approach designing software?
  I try to keep my approach to designing software simple and thorough. I start with the customer interview or requirement documents.
  From there I group together similar items. After having the groups created I start coding each group or method with all requirements 
  before continuing to the next group of items.
